1. Push your code to a new branch with format github_username/feature (git push origin main:github_username/feature)
2. For changes that involve changing dependencies, adding new functions etc, please make feature branch.
3. Be extremely careful with pushing code to main branch, as it is set to automatically update the S3 bucket.
