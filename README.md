# Important: CryptoSwap workflow guideline

1. You are to push your code to a new branch with format github_username/feature (git push github_username/feature)
2. If your feature is nonconflicting, you can push it to the dev branch without a review. 
3. If your feature conflicts with another coworkers code (refer to their /features) then request a review from them and one more overseer.
