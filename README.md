# Important: CryptoSwap workflow guideline

1. You are to push your code to a new branch with format github_username/feature (git push origin main:github_username/feature)
2. If your feature is nonconflicting, you can push it to the dev branch without a review. 
3. If your feature conflicts with another coworkers code (refer to their /features) then request a review from them and one more overseer. 

4. Be extremely careful with pushing code to main branch, as it is set to automatically update the S3 bucket.
